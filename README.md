# Webcam motion detection
 
This project only works on windows currently. If you want to use this on linux you will need to change the CameraStream class to use a different format (not dshow).

This project will capture all your webcams and monitor them for motion. when motion is detected it will save some time before, and during the motion.

# todo

 - trigger rest apis?
 - host clips
 - trigger push notification
 - capture webcam in high quality, then downscale, then do motion detection. (higher quality clips)
